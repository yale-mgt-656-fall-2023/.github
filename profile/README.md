## Admission to the class

You can be admitted to the class by bidding in the Yale SOM bidding system.
If you are ineligible for that or you didn't get your bid, you can test 
into the class. I will save five to ten slots for such students. I'll administer
a test covering some course material the first Friday of the semester. I'll announce
the time in class. You must attend class the first week and be among the
top scoring students to join if you didn't bid into the class.

## Textbook

There is no textbook for the course. Readings will be posted on the
[class website](https://656.mba).

## Diversity, equity, inclusion and their opposites

This class will be an inclusive environment. If you see behavior
that you feel is discriminatory, _particularly_ from the professor
or teaching staff, we encourage you to avail yourself of one or
more of the following resources.

- [Preventing and Responding to Sexual Misconduct at Yale Booklet](https://smr.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Guide-Preventing-and-Responding-to-Sexual-Misconduct.pdf)
- [Yale
  Sexual Harassment and Assault Response & Education (SHARE)](https://sharecenter.yale.edu/)
- Diane Temple in SOM Human Resources and Sheri Scully in the SOM AASL.
- [Yale Title IX Coordinators](https://provost.yale.edu/title-ix/coordinators) (SOM‚Äôs Title IX Coordinator is Rebecca Udler)
- [Yale's Live Safe App](https://your.yale.edu/community/public-safety/campus-safety-services/livesafe-app)
- [Office for Equal Opportunity Programs](https://equalopportunity.yale.edu/)

## Special needs

If you have special needs in the course, please contact the instructor. For
example, you should contact the instructor in any of the following
circumstances: you wish to miss class due to religious observation; you have a
disability that makes participation in class difficult (e.g. an injury or
visual impairment that makes a written exam an inaccurate assessment of your
knowledge); or, you require particular seating arrangements in order to better
learn. Please check the [Yale student accessibility
services](https://sas.yale.edu/)
for more information.

## Office hours

Your first stop for help should be the [classroom discussion](https://github.com/orgs/yale-mgt-656-fall-2023/discussions)
on GitHub. Please only email if you need private help. 

The office hours for each of the teaching staff is shown
below. Though, if you are reading this before the start of
the semester, it is possible some staff are missing because
they did not yet determine their schedule. 

Feel free to send an email if these times do not work for you.

## Course Philosophy

If you are interested in software and technology, we think this
will be one of the best courses you take at Yale. We designed
the course with the following values.

- **You will actually write code**. If you are going to manage developers,
  you need to understand what it is like to write code. You need to
  speak their language, understand their struggles, understand how tech
  products are built, and understand some fundamentals of computer science.

- **You will use modern best-practices for managing software development**.
  There are many ways in which one can organize
  software development teams. We will teach you
  "[scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29)",
  a popular
  take on agile software development methods. If you go on to be a
  product manager at a major technology company&mdash;Google, Apple,
  Microsoft, etc.&mdash;you will most likely employ some variant of scrum.

- **You will use a modern technology stack, working on both the client
  and server side**.
  On the client side we will use web technologies
  including [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5),
  [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), and
  [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets). Delivering software via the
  web is a common choice because browsers are ubiquitous: they exist
  on every phone, tablet, laptop, and computer. On the server side we
  will use [Go](https://golang.org/), a programming language developed
  by Google. Go is a popular, "modern" alternative to
  nodejs, python, and ruby for web application development. Like all
  languages, it is imperfect. It's a reasonable choice for this course.

These are bold goals and challenging to accomplish in the brief time allotted
to us. Our greatest concern is that the technology component will be a barrier
for some students. To ensure that this is not the case, we will record numerous
videos in which the instructors show how to complete the homework and class
project.  In these videos, we discuss the different ways in which technical
goals can be achieved, explicitly show how to write the code you need, and how
to use the different services we are employing. You will get real experience
with real modern web technologies. That experience should be pleasurable,
hands-on, and minimally frustrating.


## Use of AI assistants, human assistants, and the honor code

You should totally be using AI assistants such at GitHub Copilot
(best for writing code) or ChatGPT (good for answer pre-class quiz
questions). I ask that you not copy from other humans in "real-time".
You are welcome to use the advice of other humans through media
such as StackOverflow or our [class
discussion/qa](https://github.com/orgs/yale-mgt-656-fall-2023/discussions)
and also to work on your homework with your colleagues. Given such
parameters, what do I think would constitute a violation of the
honor code? I can think of a few things: 1) blatant copying,
particularly in serial; 2) wide spread dissemination  of answers
to quizzes or homework assignments; 3) copying from a human in
real-time; 4) use of unauthorized resources during an exam;
5) efforts to thwart faithful grading, such as fibbing about time
of submission.  What's the bottom line? We're all adults. I want
you to learn, I want you to have fun, and I want to faithfully
report a grade that reflects your "real world" subject matter
competence at the end of the term. Don't do things that mess that
up.

## Quizzes

Most classes are preceded by a quiz that you take
through the class website. The quizzes are short, timed, multiple choice,
mandatory, and ultimately a crude and imperfect assessment of
the degree to which you understand the pre-class reading material.
The following are my reasons for giving pre-class quizzes:

1. It makes you think about the upcoming class!
2. Empirical evidence shows that the [testing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect)
   increases your understanding and retention of material.
3. They give you a low-stakes, super-small reward for coming to class prepared.
4. They ensure that your classmates are better prepared for class and therefore more fun to speak with.
5. They are short, you can google for stuff during the quiz, _and_ you
   can drop your lowest two scores, so they are not stressful.

You take the quizzes via the class website. Click on "meetings" then click on
the meeting for a particular class. (You can also take the quizzes via the
class API. If you're a masochist, contact me! ü§™) A button that says "Begin Quiz"
will appear if you can take the quiz.  Once you begin a quiz, you can change
your answers until either 45 minutes after you began the quiz, or the closing
time of the quiz, which is usually the beginning of class. So, if you start a
quiz five minutes prior to class, you will only have five minutes to submit the
answers to the quiz questions! The quizzes are graded only after the quiz
closes. Kyle will sometimes go over the content of the quizzes at the beginning
of class.

You can take the quiz if all of the following are true:

- The quiz is not labeled as "draft". Draft means the teaching
  staff are still working on the quiz questions.
- The current time is after the quiz is "open". Quizzes usually
  open five days before the meeting/lecture to which the quiz
  corresponds.
- The current time is not after the quiz is "closed". Quizzes
  usually close when the meeting/lecture to which the quiz
  corresponds begins.
- You did not previously take the quiz or you already started
  the quiz, but your time to take the quiz is not expired.
  All quizzes this semester will last 45 minutes but they can
  typically be completed in just five.

Once you click "Begin Quiz", you will see a list of multiple
choice questions displayed in an HTML form. For each question,
you should select the options you desire and then click
"Save Answers" at the bottom of the page. Unless there is an
error, the options that you selected will be labeled as "saved",
so that you have visual confirmation.

A few notes about the quizzes...

* The quiz questions are not uniformly drawn from material in
  the pre-class reading. Some pre-class reading will be over-represented
  and some under-represented, usually because of heterogeneous
  importance of the pre-class reading material.
* We want the quiz questions to test your conceptual understanding.
  We do not want to ask "gotcha" questions or simple recall questions.
  However, we will fall short in those aspirations often.
* Some quiz questions will have obvious answers. We do this in part
  to remind you of important concepts.
* If you feel like a quiz questions is unfair or that the answer
  is wrong, please tell Kyle. It is easy for Kyle to "fix" a bad
  question.
* Questions that have multiple correct answers are indicated as
  such in the class website.
* There is a timer at the bottom of the page in the quiz UI on 
  the class website. It shows the *approximate* time you have left
  to finish your quiz. Please monitor your time.
* It is 100% fine to google for the answers to quiz questions or to
  look in the reading material. You may not rely on another human
  being for real-time support on the quiz and you may not share
  information about the quiz with other students. You can use
  AI assistants.

## Grading

Grading will follow the [official Yale SOM grading
policy](https://portal.som.yale.edu/page/grade-policy-mba-mam-mms).  That is
_essentially_ a forced curve: a certain number of students get each grade: HH,
H, etc. In my opinion, it's a quite generous curve (though [the ethics of
grading on a curve are
dubious](https://digitalcommons.law.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?httpsredir=1&article=1153&context=elj).
I will compute the grades for non-SOM students by overlaying their school's
grading scale on top of the SOM curve. There's not a 1-to-1 correspondence.
Your letter grade will be based on your sum grade and your sum grade will be
determined _roughly_ as follows (I reserve the right to make changes. The most
common change I make is dropping assignments.)


| Component       | Percentage            | 
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| Homework     | 20% | 
| Quizzes   | 15% | 
| Exam-1 | 20% | 
| Exam-2 | 20% | 
| Group Project | 20% | 
| Participation   | 5% | 

The ethics of counting participation in the grade are also a bit dubious üôÅ.
But, I'm including it for consequentialist reasons: your participation makes
the class more fun for all of us and most importantly for me ü§£.


## Assignments

The class assignments partition into two sets: skill building
assignments that are completed individually during the first half of the semester, and a class project
that is completed in a small team employing your new technical and
management skills during the second half the semester.

In the skill building homework assignments, you will develop an
understanding of the various technologies used to build user-facing
web applications, particularly [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5),
[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript),
[CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets),
[Golang](http://golang.org),
and
[git](http://git-scm.com/). You will also familiarize yourself with
various services that we will use during the semester, particularly
[GitHub](https://github.com/).
Most students will likely choose to _write_ their code using
[GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview),
which we get for free as part of our GitHub Education account.
It's basically just a coding environment in the cloud
so you don't need to install anything on your computer. Of course, you can
complete assignments on your own computer if you prefer---that's what I do!
Some homework assignments require that you _deploy_ your code somewhere. 
That means you'll write your code in one place and then send it to another
place where it can run ``professionally''. You'll likely deploy your code
to a cloud platform like [Render](https://render.com/),
[Fly.io](https://fly.io/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), or
[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/). (I believe it is fair to say
that most students were happy with Render last semester. Heroku is nice
but now lacks a free tier.)


You must submit  some information about each of the assignments through the class website.
However, assignments can only be submitted if 1) they are not labeled
as "draft"; and, 2) the current time is before the assignment is
"closed" (or due). With rare exception, assignments will require
you to submit one or more "fields"---a URL, some text, etc. Most
often, these will be URLs pointing to web applications that you build
online and your Git repositories on GitHub. After the assignment is
closed (due), the instructors will grade the assignment using the
information you submitted.

When you submit your assignment, please take care that you submit
the correct information without typos. The class website will happily
suggest "foo.com" as your submission instead of the URL to your Git repo.
Many of the assignments will be graded in an automated fashion and
so a typo can have a catastrophic effect on your grade for an assignment.

For many assignments I will provide either automated testing code
or testing code online at [http://grading.656.mba](http://grading.656.mba). You can use
these tools to make sure your software is working how you expect.
